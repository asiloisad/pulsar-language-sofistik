## Installation

After the announcement of Atoms sunset, the official [Atom packages store](https://atom.io/packages) isn't respond properly, so latest version of this package cannot be downloaded there. To get latest version run the shell command

    apm install bacadra/atom-language-sofistik

and obtain the package directly from Github repository. Please note that package will occur in `Settings/Packages/Git Packages` instead of `Community Packages`.

## Compatibility

**Support versions of SOFiSTiK are 2022, 2020 and 2018. Only Enligsh.**

As the package supports many versions of SOFiSTiK and commands are constantly changing, the package offers hints that may no longer be valid in a given version.
